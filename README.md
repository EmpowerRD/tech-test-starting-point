# Tech Test Starting Point

This is a barebones repo to serve as the starting point for a tech test. It has an example class with example tests in both minitest and rspec.

You are free to setup your own ruby project if you prefer with your preferred testing setup. Do not use a rails application as the starting point as this will be overkill for the tech test and will only waste time.

## Dependencies

You will need to have ruby installed on your machine.

Install the dependencies with

```
bundle install
```

## Running minitest tests
```
ruby tests/calculator_test.rb
```

## Running the rspec tests
```
bundle exec rspec
```
